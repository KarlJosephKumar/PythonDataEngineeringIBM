Jupyter files are included

Firstly I webscraped largest banks by their market cap from:

In the second task I extracted the information from a json and a csv file and removed unnecessary columns which I webscraped.

In the third task I transformed data on the bank list file.

Changed currency, names and decimals.

The user can provide a currency of their liking from the currencies available from the exchange_rates.csv files.

In case of a wrong currency or no value the currency will not be changed.
